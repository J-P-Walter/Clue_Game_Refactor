# ClueGame

Working on refactoring this Clue Game that was made my sophmore year. Code is currently a mess and I hope to clean it up a bit. Stretch goal is to see if there any ways to optimize the game, fix bugs if found, possibly create an AI to play.

If you want to compare, https://github.com/J-P-Walter/ClueGame is the link to the original project.
